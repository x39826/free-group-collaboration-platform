# free-group-collaboration-platform
An exciting free group collaboration platform under development
                      
                       Welcome to the future!
            
Today is a very meaningful day in history

Because it is the beginning of a great open source software 

Everyone involved is his father	

It will grow under the care of everyone	

One day in the future, everyone will depend on it	

Any idea can be realized on it	

People will work together, study, study and live happily	

For this goal, we play their own strength	

Today, we set out!	

                        What it is?

It is now a GitHub project that requires interested people to grow up

no matter how much contribution, even if it is an idea, a vision

It's what it takes for you to decide together

everyone can add their own ideas and contributions

time will shape its shape

                        Why we need it?

Github is not a perfect tool for ideas's realization, 

for it splits the world into visual individuals and resources.

people can only publish projects and provide contributions 
 
We can't publish a topic we're interested in

and we can't decide whether a topic should go on

The topic includes not only resources

any people's needs should also be included

each need must has a corresponding demand for resources

each resource must also have the corresponding requirements

good demand, good resources, such collaboration will be healthy to run down.
